# Skyvern Official Result Request

Target project: `Skyvern`

Primary ask: invite maintainers or power users to submit a reviewed LexBench-Browser result for
the `skyvern` adapter.

## Suggested Message

```text
Hi Skyvern maintainers,

We support running Skyvern in LexBench-Browser and would like to invite an official result
submission from your team or community.

browseruse-agent-bench is a reproducible browser-agent benchmark framework. LexBench-Browser is
its default public dataset, with 210 no-login tasks across 107 websites. The framework records
success rate, task-level artifacts, steps, latency, token/cost metrics, model settings, and
browser backend.

For Skyvern, the most useful official result would include:
- Skyvern version or commit
- model provider and model ID
- browser backend and launch mode
- proxy or region notes if used
- benchmark split and version
- run command and evaluation command
- redacted config
- task-level artifacts
- known skips, retries, provider incidents, or browser constraints

Closed-source model/provider settings are acceptable if reproducibility limits are disclosed.
Maintainers review and rerun results before they become official leaderboard entries.

Would you be interested in submitting or reviewing an official Skyvern result?
```

## Local Prep

- Verify current Skyvern config requirements before outreach.
- Include proxy guidance if suggesting local Chrome from mainland China.
- Ask whether maintainers prefer local launch or a cloud browser session.
- Record any Skyvern-specific retry behavior in the result metadata.
