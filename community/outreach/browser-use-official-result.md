# browser-use Official Result Request

Target project: `browser-use`

Primary ask: invite maintainers or power users to submit a reviewed LexBench-Browser result for
the `browser-use` adapter.

## Suggested Message

Hi browser-use maintainers,

We support running browser-use in LexBench-Browser and would like to invite an official result
submission from your team or community.

LexBench-Browser is a reproducible browser-agent benchmark with 210 public no-login tasks across
107 websites. It is built around an engineering workflow: run your agent, compare browser
backends, inspect trajectories, and submit reviewed results with enough metadata for rerun.

For browser-use, the most useful official result would include:
- browser-use version or commit
- model provider and model ID
- browser backend: local Chrome, Lexmount, AgentBay, CDP, or another backend
- benchmark split and version
- run command and evaluation command
- redacted config
- task-level artifacts
- success rate, steps, latency, token usage, and cost where available
- known skips, retries, provider incidents, or browser constraints

Closed-source model/provider settings are acceptable if reproducibility limits are disclosed.
Maintainers review and rerun results before they become official leaderboard entries.

Would you be interested in submitting or reviewing an official browser-use result?

## Local Prep

- Verify the quickstart still runs with `uv sync --extra browser-use`.
- Prefer a small sample first: `uv run bubench run --agent browser-use --data LexBench-Browser --mode first_n --count 3`.
- Ask whether maintainers want to compare local Chrome and one cloud backend.
- If the project has a preferred model/provider config, record it in the submission metadata.
